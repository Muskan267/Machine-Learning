# **Sentiment Analysis of Omicron Variant on Twitter**  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes public sentiment regarding the Omicron variant using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The dataset, sourced from **Kaggle**, contains Twitter mentions about Omicron. The goal is to classify sentiments as **positive, negative, or neutral**, helping to understand public perception during the pandemic.

## **Key Features**  
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Cleaned and processed raw text data to remove noise, stopwords, and special characters.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the distribution of sentiments and visualized key trends in public opinion.  
- **Sentiment Classification**: Applied machine learning and NLP techniques to classify tweets into different sentiment categories.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Achieved **84% accuracy** in sentiment classification using various machine learning models.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** (NLTK, SpaCy)  
- **Machine Learning** (Scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis  

## **Results & Insights**  
The model successfully captured sentiment trends, revealing shifts in public perception over time. These insights can aid policymakers, researchers, and healthcare organizations in understanding public reactions to new COVID-19 variants.
